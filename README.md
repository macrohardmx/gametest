# Gametest
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/macrohardmx/gametest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/macrohardmx/gametest)

This is my experiment into rust game development.


## Running and Compiling

# Windows
To run, all you need to do is install `rust` and `cargo` and run:
```
$ cargo run
```

# Ubuntu
They're pretty similar to those for Windows, but you need to install these dependencies
first:

```
$ sudo apt install -y libasound2-dev libudev-dev
```

And then, after installing `rust` and `cargo`, run:
```
$ cargo run
```
